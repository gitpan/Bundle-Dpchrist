INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    Note that when this module is installed the first time, the commands
    'perl Makefile.PL' and 'make test' will generate a warning similar to:

        skipping Dpchrist::Module::MakefilePL: Can't locate Dpchrist/Module/
        MakefilePL.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/perl/
        5.10.0 /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0 /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 
        /usr/lib/perl/5.10 /usr/share/perl/5.10 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) 
        at Makefile.PL line 23.

    These warnings may be safely ignored.

  DEPENDENCIES
    This module depends upon Dpchrist::Module, which is installed by this
    module.

    For the curious, see Makefile.PL in the source distribution root
    directory for the BEGIN{eval{...}} solution to this chicken-and-egg
    problem.
